# IoT-Based-Anesthesia-Control-and-Monitoring-System
Anesthesia plays a critical role in modern medicine by enabling pain-free surgeries and procedures. Anesthesiologists, the specialists who administer anesthesia, are responsible for monitoring vital parameters such as heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and body temperature to ensure the patient's safety during surgery. A slight variation in these parameters can be life-threatening, requiring quick intervention. 

Our system provides a smart and automated solution to assist anesthesiologists by continuously monitoring these critical parameters and automating the anesthesia delivery process through a Servo motor. Additionally, the real-time data is displayed on a Mobile device, ensuring accessibility for healthcare professionals anywhere.

How It Helps:
Our system enhances the role of anesthesiologists by:

• Providing continuous real-time monitoring of patient vitals.

• Ensuring data accessibility on mobile devices for remote monitoring.

• Reducing human error by automating anesthesia delivery based on monitored parameters.

• Improving patient safety during surgery and critical care

Key Features:
• Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks and displays patient vitals such as heart rate, oxygen levels, temperature and other critical parameters to ensure safe administration of anesthesia. 

• Automatic Regulation: Implements precise adjustments of anesthesia dosage based on the patient’s real-time condition, reducing the risk of under or over-dosage.
